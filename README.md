# GAN

A generative model with both ​discrete and continuous​ latent spaces.
This model gets as input a vector which is half discrete and half continous. 

The model was trained with those parameters: 
  Num_epochs = 50, Learning rate=0.0002, Latent_size = 100, Batch_size = 128, 
  Hidden_layers = 64, Betas=0.5, 0.999, Optimization: Adam
